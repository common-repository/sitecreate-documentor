The plugin was created to solve a problem I was having, I wanted a simple way to turn a regaular WP page into easy to navigate documentation with a neat ToC, which was easy enough with some jQuery, but I also wanted to the user to be able to download an offline version should the choose to, so I cooked up this widget and here we are.
